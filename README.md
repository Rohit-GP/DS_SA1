# SKILL-ASSSESMENT-1
# AIM:
  To perform a comprehensive data science assessment using Python, applying key concepts such as data cleaning, analysis,
  and basic machine learning techniques.

# EXPLANATION:
Data Science involves extracting meaningful insights from structured or unstructured data using scientific methods, algorithms, and tools. Python, being a versatile programming language, provides libraries like Pandas, NumPy and  Scikit-learn that enable data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. This assessment ensures practical understanding and command over essential data science operations.

# ALGORITHM:
STEP 1: Import necessary libraries: pandas, numpy.

STEP 2: Create a dataframe with the help of pandas.

STEP 3: Perform basic data cleaning:

  - Handle missing values using .isnull(), .dropna(), or .fillna().

  - Remove duplicates using .duplicated().

  - Convert data types if necessary using .astype().

STEP 4: Perform data manipulation using pandas and numpy:

  - Filter rows or columns.

  - Apply aggregation functions (like .mean(), .sum(), etc.).

STEP 5: Display or save the results as required.

#  CODING AND OUTPUT:

NAME :  ROHIT GP

REGISTER NUMBER : 212224220082

# Result:
 Basic operations on the dataset were successfully performed using pandas and NumPy. The data was cleaned by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
